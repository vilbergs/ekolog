# Ekolog

A dead-simple echo server that stores log entries

## Why

I made this so that I could capture console logs and exceptions from browsers on mobile devices, where connecting accessing the device dev-tools was not an option.

## Features

- Stores logs in a key-value store.
- Echoes/logs out any requests made to the server
- Docker ready
